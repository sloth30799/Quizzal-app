Welcome to the Quizzal-App! The quizzal app is a quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge in various subjects. The app fetches quiz questions and answers from an external API and displays them to the user. 

# How It's Made:

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

For database, Used the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

# Optimizations

Might add some new features like user login, signup and add feature to keep the score and make category and diffculty choosable.

# Lessons Learned:

Learned how to use React to build better and interactive user interfaces.

# How to Use

Click the start quiz! The user can then select an answer and submit their answers to see how many they got correct. The app also allows users to play again by resetting the quiz data and allowing them to start a new quiz.

# Note

The default difficulty is setted to hard. xD
